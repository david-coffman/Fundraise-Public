# Fundraise-Public
Public version of Fundraise.

### Purpose
Fundraise takes csv-formatted campaign donor lists (available publicly from the North Carolina State Board of Elections) and attempts to construct donation histories for donors in those lists. Campaigns can then use these histories to identify potential donors.
